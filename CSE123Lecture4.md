## Reliable Transmission
- Want to implement some reliability in the transport layer to improve performance


## Pipelined Transmission
- Servers get filled up with frame buffers for multiple clients (Maintain frame buffer in case of re-transmission)
    - Need tons of RAM

## Go-Back-N Re-Transmission
- First frame only relies on timeout for re-transmission
